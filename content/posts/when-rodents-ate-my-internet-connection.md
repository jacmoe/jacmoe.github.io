In a Vox interview (<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_2">“Neil Gaiman: Boredom Is a Writer’s Best Friend - Vox” n.d.</a>) Neil Gaiman was asked what advice he would give to beginning writers. And his advice was to get bored. “Ideas come from daydreaming,” he explained. “They come from drifting.”

> You have to let yourself get so bored that your mind has nothing better to do than tell itself a story – Neil Gaiman

Agatha Christie, who had no formal education until she was 16 years old, credits having to find her own ways to entertain herself with kickstarting her prolific writing career.

The following quote is taken from an 1955 BBC interview (<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_1">“Agatha Christie Interview” n.d.</a>):

> There’s nothing like boredom to make you write – Agatha Christie
