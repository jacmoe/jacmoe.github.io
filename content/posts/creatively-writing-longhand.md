## Preface {#preface}

Two years ago I wanted to start writing by hand. I quickly realized, however, that I couldn't do it. My handwriting was inefficient, inconsistent and unreadable. My hand cramped up and I could not write for more than fifteen minutes at a time.
  I have written journals by hand all my life, but with the advent of the computer I stopped writing in longhand. And I forgot how to do it. Since I wanted to go back to do creative writing by hand, I knew that I had to do something.

## Notes {#notes}


### Benefits of writing {#benefits-of-writing}


#### Increases learning comprehension {#increases-learning-comprehension}

Putting ink on paper stimulates a part of the brain called the Reticular Activating System, or the RAS. It works by giving more importance to the things you are actively focusing on.

### Spencerian script {#spencerian-script}

Spencerian Script is a script styled developed by Platt Rogers Spencer in 1840. His script was based on already existing scripts, inspired by the shapes found in nature, resulting in a unique oval-based penmanship style that could be written very quickly and legibly. For the first time you didn't have to lift your pen

From 1850 to 1925, Spencerian Script was the de facto writing style for business correspondence in the United States of America. It was the first longhand where you didn't have to lift your hand in the middle of words and was both rapid and highly legible. In the 1920s the growing popularity of the typewriter rendered it obsolete as the primary means of written communication in business.

This [guideline generator](https://shipbrook.net/guidelines/) can generate PDF guidelines especially for Spencerian writing. I usually set all the lines to "Non-photo blue" and print out a bunch to practice on.

You can get the [New Spencerian Compendium](https://www.iampeth.com/pdf/new-spencerian-compendium/) from the IAMPETH (International Association of Master Penmen) website. That site also have a wealth of resources, so be sure to explore.
