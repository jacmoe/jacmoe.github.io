The first entry of my [Gemini](https://gemini.circumlunar.space/) Log (Gemlog) is up: [2023-03-17 - Hello, Universe!](https://tilde.team/~jacmoe/gemfeed/2023-03-17-hello-universe.html)

I am thinking that my Gemini Capsule should be a place for me to share my writing, my writerâ€™s journal, and my musings about writing.

Much simpler to put something up on Gemini: simply write a simple text, and put it on the server.

Hereâ€™s to many more entries in the Gemlog! ðŸš€
