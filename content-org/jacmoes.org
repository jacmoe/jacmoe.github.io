I used Emacs to export to WordPress, and had to tweak the HTML, and that has obviously put me off writing blog posts, as evidenced by the single blog post in two and a half years. Hugo, Github Pages, and the excellent Ox-hugo Org-mode exporter has made my blogging pipe-line smooth and enjoyable. I expect to blog a lot more in the future.

My [[https://jacmoes.wordpress.com/][old blog]] at WordPress only has one single post in it.

I wrote it using Org-mode in Emacs, and used an extension to put it on WordPress.

That was good.

I had to perform a lot of tweaking to the HTML, however, and that has obviously put me off just writing blog posts.

That was bad.

So, I wanted something as easy as writing a blog post in my favorite writing environment, committing the changes to git source control, and pushing it to a remote repository to be hosted. I don't want to deal with a website like WordPress, to be honest.

** Hugo and Emacs
After hunting around, I stumbled over a good workflow using [[https://gohugo.io/][Hugo ]] and the excellent Emacs extension =ox-hugo=.
All I have to do is write my blog posts in one org-file within Emacs, export to Hugo using the exporter, and let Hugo generate the output. Then I commit the changes to my git repository, push it to GitHub, and my homepage is updated.

I don't have to mess around with anything, like I did in WordPress.

Since it's now going to be much easier to get a blog post up, I am sure I will actually blog a post or two now :)

I have several ideas, and the good thing about it is, that I can have those posts in my org-file, as sub-trees, because the [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/][Emacs Hugo exporter]] will only export the trees that are =DONE=, not the ones marked with =TODO=.

It should be easy to blog, and I am most comfortable in Emacs. So, there's that :)
