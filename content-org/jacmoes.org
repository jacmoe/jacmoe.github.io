** Preface
Two years ago I wanted to start writing by hand. I quickly realized, however, that I couldn't do it. My handwriting was inefficient, inconsistent and unreadable. My hand cramped up and I could not write for more than fifteen minutes at a time.
  I have written journals by hand all my life, but with the advent of the computer I stopped writing in longhand. And I forgot how to do it. Since I wanted to go back to do creative writing by hand, I knew that I had to do something.

** Notes
*** Benefits of writing
**** Increases learning comprehension
 Putting ink on paper stimulates a part of the brain called the Reticular Activating System, or the RAS. It works by giving more importance to the things you are actively focusing on.

 A [[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704631504575531932754922518][study from 2010]]

**** Fully engages your brain
 Writing requires that you use more of your motor skills. Reading circuit. Activates more parts of your brain than typing.

**** Calms the body and nerves

**** Slows down mental aging

**** Unleashes creativity

**** Eases depression and anxiety

**** Enhances focus

**** Stimulates the brain

**** Makes you a better writer

*** Spencerian script
 Spencerian Script is a script styled developed by Platt Rogers Spencer in 1840. His script was based on already existing scripts, inspired by the shapes found in nature, resulting in a unique oval-based penmanship style that could be written very quickly and legibly. For the first time you didn't have to lift your pen

 From 1850 to 1925, Spencerian Script was the de facto writing style for business correspondence in the United States of America. It was the first longhand where you didn't have to lift your hand in the middle of words and was both rapid and highly legible. In the 1920s the growing popularity of the typewriter rendered it obsolete as the primary means of written communication in business.

**** Variants
***** Spencerian Standard Hand
***** Spencerian Business Hand

***** Spencerian Abbreviated Hand

***** Spencerian Script
**** Further developments
***** Palmer method
***** Zaner-Boser
***** D'Nealian

*** Resources
**** Guideline generator
 This [[https://shipbrook.net/guidelines/][guideline generator]] can generate PDF guidelines especially for Spencerian writing. I usually set all the lines to "Non-photo blue" and print out a bunch to practice on.

**** New Spencerian Compendium
 You can get the [[https://www.iampeth.com/pdf/new-spencerian-compendium/][New Spencerian Compendium]] from the IAMPETH (International Association of Master Penmen) website. That site also have a wealth of resources, so be sure to explore.

**** Spencerian Method and copybooks
 You can download a copy of Spencerian Penmanship and the five copybooks here: [[https://www.docdroid.net/oxwk/theory-of-the-spencerian-method-of-papractical-penmanship-and-five-copybooks.pdf][Theory of the Spencerian method of penmanship and five copybooks]].

**** Palmer Method
 There is a website dedicated to the Palmer method of business writing: [[https://palmermethod.com/]] where you can find a series of self-teaching lessons.

I used Emacs to export to WordPress, and had to tweak the HTML, and that has obviously put me off writing blog posts, as evidenced by the single blog post in two and a half years. Hugo, Github Pages, and the excellent Ox-hugo Org-mode exporter has made my blogging pipe-line smooth and enjoyable. I expect to blog a lot more in the future.

My [[https://jacmoes.wordpress.com/][old blog]] at WordPress only has one single post in it.

I wrote it using Org-mode in Emacs, and used an extension to put it on WordPress.

That was good.

I had to perform a lot of tweaking to the HTML, however, and that has obviously put me off just writing blog posts.

That was bad.

So, I wanted something as easy as writing a blog post in my favorite writing environment, committing the changes to git source control, and pushing it to a remote repository to be hosted. I don't want to deal with a website like WordPress, to be honest.

** Hugo and Emacs
After hunting around, I stumbled over a good workflow using [[https://gohugo.io/][Hugo ]] and the excellent Emacs extension =ox-hugo=.
All I have to do is write my blog posts in one org-file within Emacs, export to Hugo using the exporter, and let Hugo generate the output. Then I commit the changes to my git repository, push it to GitHub, and my homepage is updated.

I don't have to mess around with anything, like I did in WordPress.

Since it's now going to be much easier to get a blog post up, I am sure I will actually blog a post or two now :)

I have several ideas, and the good thing about it is, that I can have those posts in my org-file, as sub-trees, because the [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/][Emacs Hugo exporter]] will only export the trees that are =DONE=, not the ones marked with =TODO=.

It should be easy to blog, and I am most comfortable in Emacs. So, there's that :)
