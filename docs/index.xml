      <description>Preface Two years ago I wanted to start writing by hand. I quickly realized, however, that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t do it. My handwriting was inefficient, inconsistent and unreadable. My hand cramped up and I could not write for more than fifteen minutes at a time. I have written journals by hand all my life, but with the advent of the computer I stopped writing in longhand. And I forgot how to do it.</description>

      <description>My old blog at WordPress only has one single post in it.
I wrote it using Org-mode in Emacs, and used an extension to put it on WordPress.
That was good.
I had to perform a lot of tweaking to the HTML, however, and that has obviously put me off just writing blog posts.
That was bad.
So, I wanted something as easy as writing a blog post in my favorite writing environment, committing the changes to git source control, and pushing it to a remote repository to be hosted.</description>
