      <description>My new Emacs powered blog My old blog at WordPress only has one single post in it.
I wrote it using Org-mode in Emacs, and used an extension to put it on WordPress.
That was good.
I had to perform a lot of tweaking to the HTML, however, and that has obviously put me off just writing blog posts.
That was bad.
So, I wanted something as easy as writing a blog post in my favorite writing environment, committing the changes to git source control, and pushing it to a remote repository to be hosted.</description>
