<p>My <a href="https://jacmoes.wordpress.com/">old blog</a> at WordPress only has one single post in it.</p>
<p>I wrote it using Org-mode in Emacs, and used an extension to put it on WordPress.</p>
<p>That was good.</p>
<p>I had to perform a lot of tweaking to the HTML, however, and that has obviously put me off just writing blog posts.</p>
<p>That was bad.</p>
<p>So, I wanted something as easy as writing a blog post in my favorite writing environment, committing the changes to git source control, and pushing it to a remote repository to be hosted. I don&rsquo;t want to deal with a website like WordPress, to be honest.</p>
<h2 id="hugo-and-emacs">Hugo and Emacs</h2>
<p>After hunting around, I stumbled over a good workflow using <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo </a> and the excellent Emacs extension <code>ox-hugo</code>.
All I have to do is write my blog posts in one org-file within Emacs, export to Hugo using the exporter, and let Hugo generate the output. Then I commit the changes to my git repository, push it to GitHub, and my homepage is updated.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have to mess around with anything, like I did in WordPress.</p>
<p>Since it&rsquo;s now going to be much easier to get a blog post up, I am sure I will actually blog a post or two now :)</p>
<p>I have several ideas, and the good thing about it is, that I can have those posts in my org-file, as sub-trees, because the <a href="https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/">Emacs Hugo exporter</a> will only export the trees that are <code>DONE</code>, not the ones marked with <code>TODO</code>.</p>
<p>It should be easy to blog, and I am most comfortable in Emacs. So, there&rsquo;s that :)</p>
